1. What is structured output in machine learning? 

Answer: It's just an unbrella term. You could refer to any supervised learning techniques that involve predicting structured
objects, rather than a discrete or real scalar.

2. What the hell is part-of-speech tagging?

Answer: 首先要知道什么叫part of speech？如果去翻一下有道词典[part of speech](http://dict.youdao.com/w/eng/part%20of%20speech/#keyfrom=dict2.index)，它会告诉你，原来中文含义是词性，而不是像它的逐字翻译那样的意思。现在就很好理解，part-of-speech tagging其实就是词性标注的意思，简单说就是你的模型要给出当前的单词属于名词、形容词、副词、介词等的哪一种。
